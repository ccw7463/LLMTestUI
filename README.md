# LLM Testing UI

This project is a UI developed for testing and comparing the performance of multiple large language models (LLMs). The interface is designed to support evaluation of different models' outputs using **Chainlit** as the backend for generating model responses.

## Models Included
The UI is configured to test the following models:
1. **Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct**: A versatile instruct model optimized for natural language tasks.
2. **Meta-Llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**: Meta's 8B instruct model, designed for high performance on a variety of NLP tasks.
3. **Google/Gemma-2-9B-IT**: Google's 9B parameter model, Gemma-2, specialized for instruction tasks in Italian (IT) but capable of multilingual performance.
